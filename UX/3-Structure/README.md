#3) Structure

The skeleton is a concrete expression of the more abstract structure of the site. The skeleton might define the placement of the interface elements on our checkout page; the structure would define how users got to that page and where they could go when they were finished there. The skeleton might define the arrangement of naviga- tional elements allowing the users to browse categories of products; the structure would define what those categories were.
