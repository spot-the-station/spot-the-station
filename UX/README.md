##1) [Strategy](https://github.com/spot-the-station/spot-the-station/tree/planning/UX/1-Strategy)
The scope is fundamentally determined by the strategy of the site. This strategy incorporates not only what the people running the site want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the site as well. In the case of our store example, some of the strategic objectives are pretty obvious: Users want to buy products, and we want to sell them. Other objectives—such as the role that advertis- ing or content produced by our users plays in our business model, for example—might not be so easy to articulate.

##2) [Scope](https://github.com/spot-the-station/spot-the-station/tree/planning/UX/2-Scope)
The structure defines the way in which the various features and functions of the site fit together. Just what those features and functions are constitutes the scope of the site. For example, some commerce sites offer a feature that enables users to save previously used shipping addresses so they can be used again. Whether that feature—or any feature—is included on a site is a question of scope.


##3) [Structure](https://github.com/spot-the-station/spot-the-station/tree/planning/UX/3-Structure)
The skeleton is a concrete expression of the more abstract structure of the site. The skeleton might define the placement of the interface elements on our checkout page; the structure would define how users got to that page and where they could go when they were finished there. The skeleton might define the arrangement of naviga- tional elements allowing the users to browse categories of products; the structure would define what those categories were.

##4) [Skeleton](https://github.com/spot-the-station/spot-the-station/tree/planning/UX/4-Skeleton)
Beneath that surface is the skeleton of the site: the placement of buttons, controls, photos, and blocks of text. The skeleton is designed to optimize the arrangement of these elements for maximum effect and efficiency—so that you remember the logo and can find that shopping cart button when you need it.

##5) [Surface](https://github.com/spot-the-station/spot-the-station/tree/planning/UX/5-Surface)
On the surface you see a series of Web pages, made up of images and text. Some of these images are things you can click on, per- forming some sort of function such as taking you to a shopping cart. Some of these images are just illustrations, such as a photograph of a product for sale or the logo of the site itself.
